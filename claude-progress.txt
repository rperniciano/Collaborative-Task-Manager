   - Registered new user (testuser_feature8) and was redirected to board
   - Navigated to http://localhost:4200/board
   - API call to /api/app/board/board returned 200 with board and columns data
   - Verified all three columns display correctly:
     - ✅ "To-Do" column exists with "0 tasks" count

     - ✅ "Done" column exists with "0 tasks" count
   - Verified columns are displayed side by side in kanban layout

## Session 6 - 2026-01-19 (Parallel Agent - Feature #19)

### Status
- Features: 6/124 passing (4.8%)
- Current feature: #19 "User can create a task" - BLOCKED (requires server restart)

### Investigation Summary

1. **Tested Feature #19: User can create a task**
   - Registered new user (feature19_test)
   - Navigated to board view - columns display correctly
   - Clicked "+ Add task" button in To-Do column - form appeared
   - Entered task title: "TEST_FEATURE_19_UNIQUE_TASK"
   - Clicked "Add" button
   - Result: 500 Internal Server Error

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - API endpoint `/api/app/task` returns 500 error
   - API endpoint `/api/app/task/tasks` also returns 500 error
   - Root cause: The AppTasks database table does not exist
   - The migration code exists in `CollaborativeTaskManagerHttpApiHostModule.cs` (auto-creates table on startup)
   - However, this code was uncommitted and the server was started before the change was made

3. **Fix Applied**
   - Committed the auto-migration code that creates AppTasks table on startup
   - Commit: "feat: Add auto-migration for AppTasks table on startup"
   - The fix requires a SERVER RESTART to take effect

### Blocker
**The backend server needs to be restarted for the database migration to run.**

The commands to restart are blocked in this environment:
- `dotnet` command not allowed
- `sqlcmd` command not allowed
- `powershell` command not allowed

### What Was Implemented (Ready for Testing After Restart)
1. **TaskAppService.cs** - Full CRUD operations for tasks
   - CreateAsync - Creates task with title, priority, description, due date
   - GetAllTasksAsync - Gets all tasks for current user's board
   - GetTasksByColumnAsync - Gets tasks for specific column
   - DeleteAsync - Deletes a task

2. **BoardTask.cs** - Domain entity with all required fields
   - Id, ColumnId, Title, Description, DueDate, Priority, AssigneeId, Order

3. **Angular board.component** - Full UI implementation
   - "+ Add task" button per column
   - Inline task creation form
   - Task display with priority badges
   - API integration

4. **Auto-migration in HttpApiHostModule**
   - Creates AppTasks table if it doesn't exist on startup

### Next Steps
1. **REQUIRED**: Restart the backend server to apply the migration
   - Run: `dotnet run --project src/CollaborativeTaskManager.HttpApi.Host`
   - Or run the DbMigrator: `dotnet run --project src/CollaborativeTaskManager.DbMigrator`

2. After restart, verify feature #19:
   - Create a task via UI
   - Verify task appears in column
   - Verify task persists after page refresh
   - Verify API returns 200

### Files Modified This Session
- src/CollaborativeTaskManager.HttpApi.Host/CollaborativeTaskManagerHttpApiHostModule.cs (committed)

### Decision
Since the blocker is infrastructure-related (server restart required) and I cannot restart the server, I will skip this feature to allow other agents to potentially work on it after the server is restarted.
